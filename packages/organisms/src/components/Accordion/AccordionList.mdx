# AccordionList
The "AccordionList" component is a user interface that allows content to be organized and presented in a hierarchical and compact manner. 
It consists of a series of collapsible sections or panels, where only one section is expanded at a time, while the others are kept 
closed. Users can click on the header of each section to expand it and view its content, which helps conserve screen space and 
facilitates navigation in interfaces with extensive content.

Within the @lottuseducation/organisms library, the AccordionList component comprises the following elements : "AccordionList.Button","AccordionList.Panel".
By leveraging these components, a multitude of distinct designs for AccordionList can be crafted.

- AccordionList: the main container of the accordion component
- AccordionList.Button: The element actionable that open/close the information panels
- AccordionList.Panel: each content for button accordion.

## Installation and import
To integrate this component, we install the @lottuseducation/organisms library.
This library seamlessly combines unstyled yet fully accessible UI components into our projects,
 meticulously designed to complement Tailwind CSS integration.

To get started, initiate the installation of @lottuseducation/organisms via npm:

  ``` npm install @lottuseducation/organisms ```
After installing the library, you can import the component into your project as follows:
