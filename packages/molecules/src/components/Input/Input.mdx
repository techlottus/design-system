# Input Group

The Input Group is a fundamental component commonly employed within forms,
 facilitating user input across various data types such as text, numbers, emails, and passwords, among others.
  It serves as a conduit for both sending and collecting inputted data. Within the @lottuseducation/molecules library, 
  the Input Group component comprises three integral elements: "InputGroup.InputText," "InputGroup.RightElement," and
   "InputGroup.LeftElement." By leveraging these components, a multitude of distinct designs for input groups can be crafted.
- InputGroup: The primary component that encompasses all elements within the input group.
- InputGroup.RightElement: Contains the children for the right section of the input group.
- InputGroup.InputText: This central component holds the input text and receives a label, along with all the properties of the HTML input element.
- InputGroup.LeftElement: Holds the children for the left side of the input group
