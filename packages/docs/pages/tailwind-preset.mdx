# Tailwind Preset
<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">Currently on a canary pipeline.</Callout>

Documentation of the `tailwind-base` preset based on Bedu's Design System. Learn how to use our own configurable preset in your TailwindCSS projects.

## Installation
To get started, install `@bedu-tmp/tailwind-base` via `yarn`:
```bash
# Yarn
yarn add @bedu-tmp/tailwind-base
```

## How to use
By default, any configuration you add in your own `tailwind.config.js` file is intelligently merged with the default configuration, with your own configuration acting as a set of overrides and extensions.

The presets option lets you specify a different configuration to use as your base, making it easy to package up a set of customizations that youâ€™d like to reuse across projects.

```js highlight=20
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    require('@bedu-tmp/tailwind-base').default,
  ],
  // ...
}
```

This can be very useful for teams that manage multiple Tailwind projects for the same brand where they want a single source of truth for colors, fonts, and other common customizations.

## Colors
<Palette />

## Extending
If you want to add a missing spacing, shadows, borders, etc, you can define any configuration you add in your own `tailwind.config.js` file.
```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    require('@bedu-tmp/tailwind-base').default,
  ],
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
