# SelectAutocomplete

The Textarea component is designed to enable users to input multiple lines of text and larger content, 
in contrast to the Input Text component. Depending on the content, the component may automatically expand or remain fixed.

It is primarily utilized in web forms, allowing users to input comments, notes, descriptions, and more.

Within the @lottuseducation/molecules library, the SelectAutocomplete component comprises the following optional elements : 
"SelectAutocomplete.LeftElement","SelectAutocomplete.RightElement". By leveraging these components, a multitude of 
distinct designs for SelectAutocomplete can be crafted.

- SelectAutocomplete: The primary component that encompasses all elements within the SelectAutocomplete.
  - props: variant:"outlined"| "flat", children: reactNode, HTMLSelectAutocompleteElement props.
- SelectAutocomplete.LeftElement: Contains the children for the left side of the SelectAutocomplete.
- SelectAutocomplete.RightElement: Contains the children for the Right side of the SelectAutocomplete.
